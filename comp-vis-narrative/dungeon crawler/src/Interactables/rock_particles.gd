## This function returns the current cleanup delay, which is the time in seconds that the system waits after playing the particles before it queues the node for freeing.

## This function is responsible for queuing the node for freeing after the particle effect has finished playing.
## It takes a playback_token as an argument to ensure that only the most recent play call can trigger the queue_free.
## The function waits for the specified cleanup_delay using a timer, and then checks if the playback
## token matches the current _playback_token and if the node is still inside the scene tree before calling queue_free.
## [br]
##  **Param**: playback_token (int) - The token associated with the current playback instance, used to ensure that only the most recent play call can trigger the queue_free.
